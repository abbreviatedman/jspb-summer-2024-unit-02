### Outline

- Ternary Expressions
- Combining Conditions
- Switch Statements

### Ternary Expressions

A ternary expression is a concise alternative to an if-else statement. What takes an if-else five lines of code to accomplish, a ternary expression gets done in one.

Let's start with an if-else statement.

1. Declare three number variables and do some conditional math. If x is less than y, add them; othewise (else) multiply them:

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 8;
let z = 0;

if(x < y) {
  z = x * y
} else {
  z = x + y;
}

console.log(z);
```

console.log(z);

Now to convert the if-else to a ternary:

2. Add a question mark right inside the if-block:

```js
if(x < y) {
  ? z = x * y;
} else {
  z = x + y;
}
```

3. Add a colon right inside the else-block:

```js
if(x < y) {
  ? z = x * y;
} else {
  : z = x + y;
}
```

4. Delete the if() and else, including parentheses:

```js
x < y {
  ? z = x * y;
} {
  : z = x + y;
}
```

5. Delete all the curly braces:

```js
x < y
? z = x * y;
: z = x + y;
```

6. This is all one line now, so get rid of the first semi-colon and back everything up onto the same line:

```js
x < y ? z = x * y : z = x + y;

console.log(z);
```

7. Now we can move the assignment to the start of the line. We only need _one_ assignment.

```js
z = x < y ? x * y : x + y;

console.log(z);
```

##### Placing Parentheses For Easier Parsing

Sometimes it can help to put parentheses around the 3 parts of the ternary operator for those getting used to the syntax.

``` js
z = (x < y) ? (x * y) : (x + y);
```

**This isn't needed and doesn't change the outcome**. The ternary _already_ evaluates things in that order. But placing parentheses _can_ help new-to-ternary programmers parse what's going on more easily.

##### Ternaries Are For Evaluating To One Value

Remember this basic rule and you'll always use ternaries for their intended purpose.

Ternaries are _not_ replacements for `if` statements, though they can certainly appear to be. They evaluate to a value, and are not themselves meant to be include code that has an effect.

This means that you do _not_ have to assign a variable within the ternary, but can instead assign a variable to what the ternary evaluates to.

``` js
// Wrong:
x < y ? z = x * y : z = x + y;

// Right:
z = x < y ? x * y : x + y;
```

##### Challenge:

8. Convert this if-else into a ternary:

```js
let n = 5;

if(n == 7) {
  n = 0;
} else {
  n = n + 1;
}

console.log(n);
```

9. Convert this if-else into a ternary:

```js
let num = 20;

if(num == 20) {
  num = num + 1;
} else {
  num = num - 1;
}

console.log(num);
```

### Combining Conditions

Multiple conditions can be evaluated with the && (AND) and || (OR) operators:

##### The And Operator

The `&&` (AND) operator evaluates two booleans (or truthy/falsy values) into one boolean. It requires both conditions to be truthy to evaluate to `true`.

10. Write an `if` statement with `&&` where two conditions must be true.

```js
let city = 'Texarkana';
let state = 'Texas';
let msg = '';

// && (AND) operator
if(city == 'Texarkana' && state == 'Texas') {
    msg = `Welcome to ${city}, ${state}!`;
} else {
    msg = 'This is not Texarkana, Texas--but it could be Texarkana, Arkansas or Houston, Texas';
}

console.log(msg); // Welcome to Texarkana, Texas
```

##### The Or Operator

The `||` (OR) operator evaluates two booleans (or truthy/falsy values) into one boolean. It requires only _one_ condition to be truthy to evaluate to `true`.

11. Write an if statement with `||` where only one condition must be true.

```js
// || (OR) opertor
if (city == 'Texarkana' || city == 'Houston') {
    msg = `Welcome to ${city}`; // runs
} else {
    msg = 'This is neither Texarkana nor Houston';
}

console.log(msg); // Welcome to Texarkana
```

12. Change city to 'Dallas'`, and run it again. The else part will run both times.

There can be more than two `&&` conditions.

13. Try one with three conditons; if _any_ of them are false, the `else` part runs:

```js
let R = 123;
let G = 155;
let B = 202;

if(R > 100 && G > 100 && B > 100) { // true
    msg = 'All RBG values are greater than 100';
} else {
    msg = 'At least one RBG value is 100 or less';
}

console.log(msg); // All RBG values greater than 100
```

14. Set any R, G, B values to below 100, and run it again. Now you get the else part.

15. Try using more than two `||` operators:

```js
let car = 'blue';
if (car == 'black' || car == 'silver' || car == 'blue') {
    msg = 'car is black, sliver or blue.';
} else {
    msg = 'The car is not black, sliver, or blue. It is actually ' + car;
}

console.log(msg);
```

16. Change the car color to red so that the else part runs.

### Switch Statement

An alternative to if-else if-else logic is a **switch** statement.

Unlike a ternary, a switch-case-break is used for evaluating multiple possible values for one variable, which would otherwise require "else if" logic.

you know if an `if`/`else if` statement can be converted to a `switch` statement if **BOTH** of the below are true:

- Each condition in the `if`/`else if` chain is working with the same value (usually a value referenced by a variable).
- Each condition is comparing that value to other values using `==` or `===`.

##### Converting From If/Else If

Convert if-else if-else to switch-case-break by following these guidelines:

- the evaluated variable is written just once
- there is only one set of curly braces
- there is only one set of parentheses
- there are no equality operators (==, ===)

Other differences: switch, case and break replace if-else keywords

- `switch` instead of `if` to start
- `case` instead of the conditions
- `break` instead of a code block's closing curly brace
- `default` instead of `else`

17. Write out this if-else if-else:

```js
let moneySymbol = "JPY";
let currency = "";

if (moneySymbol === "USD") {
    currency = "US Dollar";
} else if (moneySymbol === "JPY") {
    currency = "Japanese Yen";
} else if (moneySymbol === "GBP") {
    currency = "British Pound";
} else {
    currency = "Unknown";
}
```

18. Convert the if-else if-else to a switch-case-break:

```js
switch (moneySymbol) {
    case "USD":
    currency = "US dollar";
    break;
    case "JPY":
    currency = "Japanese Yen";
    break;
    case "GBP":
    currency = "British Pounds";
    break;
    default:
    currency = "Unknown";
}
```

##### Buggy Breaks

It's _very_ easy to leave off a `break`. When you do, the evaluation keeps going to the next `case`, even if the `case` isn't true.

``` js
switch (moneySymbol) {
    case "USD":
    currency = "US dollar";
    case "JPY":
    currency = "Japanese Yen";
    break;
    case "GBP":
    currency = "British Pounds";
    break;
    default:
    currency = "Unknown";
}
```

In the above code, the lack of a `break` means that if `moneySymbol` is "USD", it will execute the `currency = "US dollar"` line, followed by the `currency = "Japanese Yen"` line. As a result, in either of the first two cases, the value of `currency` will be "Japanese Yen".

This _can_ be used as a feature, so that two or more cases execute the same code. However, it's far, far more often a source of bugs.
